# Model.h5 is the model file that trained with 500 mixed (real and modified) images to categorize a given image as real or fake(modified) by detecting abnormalities,mis-behave patterns.

            NOTE: it may generate some mistake(false results) since it is trained with limited and small number of images. it can be enhanced by increasing the training dataset size and diversity.

# training_Steps.ipynb => shows each steps used to train the "Model.h5"

# to use the model first open the "loader.ipynb" file run the statements at google colab (make sure that you modify the path th the trained model )

# you can also train your own model by running each instruction in "training_Steps.ipynb".
